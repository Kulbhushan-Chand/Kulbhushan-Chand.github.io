**Gamification** is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. In laymen terms it is addition of fun and game elements in boring and repetitive tasks. 

So think of a task (like - cleaning up your room) that you would least likely to do. Now do the following -
 - Break it down to sub tasks,
 - Add some achievable goals,
 - Add points and rewards to complete that goals,
 - Add a pich of fun and cheer-up elements
 
congratulations üëè you have just gamified your most boring task

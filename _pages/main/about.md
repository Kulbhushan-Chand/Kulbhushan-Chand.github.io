**_Hmm..._**  
  
If **correctly provoked**, I can talk on any topic for any length, be it the `time jitter control in data acquisition devices` or the `journey of Po in becoming Kung-Fu panda`.  
 
> I'm the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.

<i class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></i> &nbsp; I am presently a **PhD research scholar** in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [National Institute of Technology Jalandhar](http://www.nitj.ac.in). My master thesis was on developing `a new approach for ECG signal denoising using Adaptive Filtering`    
  
<i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i> &nbsp; Previously I have worked as **Assistant Professor** and taught `Microcontroller and its applications`, `Digital Signal Processing`, `Probability and Stochastic Theory` and few other     
  
<i class="fas fa-cog"></i> &nbsp; I like doing hardware and software projects aiming to **solve some real world problem**. Most of the times I am using arduino and MATLAB   
  
<i class="fas fa-toolbox"></i> &nbsp; I am avid supporter of **Open Source Technologies** and used them for most of my projects. I have planned to open source my PhD work after completion

<i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> &nbsp; I am gamification expert. Along with my research guide, we introduced **Gamification** subject in our institute and probably the ***first and only in India***. Also teaching assistant in `Gamification course`. 
  
<i class="fas fa-basketball-ball"></i> &nbsp; I am an athlete and likes **running**, cycling and playing basketball

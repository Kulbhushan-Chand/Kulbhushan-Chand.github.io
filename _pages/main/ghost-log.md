- Learning Purr-Data
- Registered domain - kulbhushan-chand.com
- Started process of ussing cloudflare as CDN[^n4]

[^n4]: Content Delivery Network


## {{ "2018-10-25" | date: dateFormat }}
- Configured Midi instruments in Purr-Data
- Synthesized music from MATLAB --> Purr-Data --> Midi üëç

## {{ "2018-10-24" | date: dateFormat }}
- Exploring Purr-Data[^n3]
- OSC communication sucessful from MATLAB to Purr-Data üëç
- Created patch for amplitude, frequency and midi control from arduino-sensor value 

[^n3]: Purr-Data is cross-platform application of PureData with additions  

## {{ "2018-10-23" | date: dateFormat }}
- Updated personal website theme to latest commit 

## {{ "2018-10-22" | date: dateFormat }}
- Extensive RAM test (memtest86) on HPZ440 - ~5 hrs. - SUCCESS

- Exploring open source methods of sonification

## {{ "2018-10-17" | date: dateFormat }}
- Exploring [BrainBay](http://www.shifz.org/brainbay/)
- VirtualMidiSynth + soundfont installed in WS[^n2]
- WS RAM upgraded to 20GB (finally.. got the required performance for my work) üëç 

[^n2]: Workstation


## {{ "2018-10-16" | date: dateFormat }}
- Exploring [puredata](https://puredata.info/)

## {{ "2018-10-15" | date: dateFormat }}
- Implimented OSC outstream in daq-MATLAB and verified & analysed receiving stream in neuromore

## {{ "2018-10-14" | date: dateFormat }}
- Exploring [OpenViBE](http://openvibe.inria.fr/)
- Communication successful between OpenViBE(OSC send only) -- neuromore (OSC receiver)
- Neuromore community version has limited features and unsupported HRV analysis module 
- OpenViBE has OSC transmitter only
- So many trade-offs, and so little time...

## {{ "2018-10-12" | date: dateFormat }}
- Exploring [OSC protocol](https://www.aboehler.at/doku/doku.php/blog:2009:0727_install_osc_for_matlab_on_windows)
- OSC source build error, not much help in online documentation, provided dll (on sourceforge.net) not working
- Implemented OSC via UDP (help from matlabcentral)
- Communication sucessful between MATLAB(send only) -- neuromore -- OSC window app -- OSC processings app

## {{ "2018-10-11" | date: dateFormat }}
- Implemented basic working of LSL in MATLAB üëç
- Unfortunately neuromore and Open BCI does not support incoming LSL stream, instead they supports OSC protocol for input stream ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
- OpenVibe supports incomin LSL stream, however it is more suited for EEG signal analysis (not much of use, I'm not using EEG)

## {{ "2018-10-10" | date: dateFormat }}

  - Time investment required to learn in more detail
  - Preference for build in GitHub pages
  - Added plugins leads to more complexity and possible bugs
  - Planned to use ImageOptim for optimizing images locally

## {{ "2018-10-01" | date: dateFormat }}

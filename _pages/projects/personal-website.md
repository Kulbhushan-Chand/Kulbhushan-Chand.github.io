- Static website
- Light weight
- Fast
- Minimal expense

## How to use

For up and running with this project, the user should know how to host websiite with GitHub. After that there are two ways -
- **Method 1 -**     
If your intention is to make a similar website like this, I would recommend to use the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme directly which this website uses. All the details regarding this mentioned on the theme website. 

- **Method 2 -**  
I have made some changes to the theme and if you want the exact website like this project, then follow the mentioned steps -
  
  * Download the [repository](https://github.com/kulbhushanchand/kulbhushanchand.github.io) 
  
  * Change the name to your GitHub username (required for hosting on GitHub)
  
  * Make the required change in _config.yml and other places (like names, social site links etc.)
  
  * Commit to your public repository in GitHub and change repository setting to build repo as website
  
  * Since I'm using some third party services for added functionality, you may choose to use them as well (they all are free ðŸ™‚). Those are listed above under [**Hosting and other third party services**](/projects/personal-website#hosting-and-other-third-party-services)

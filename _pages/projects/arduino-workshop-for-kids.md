In 2017, I have started using arduino for my research work. My research guide and their associates liked the ideas of organizing a arduino workshop for kids. My task was to handle everything related to technical aspect and delivering presentation at workshop.

Started with the basic idea I end up creating the 15 ready to deploy, generalized arduino projects, with difficulty from easy to hard.

The workshop was successfully conducted in Nov-2017 and this repository was later made public for anyone who would like to use and get benefited from it.

This  repository contains the presentation, schematics and the arduino code required for conducting the arduino workshop for kids. The workshop is divided into 15 challenges ranging from simple to complex tasks. Each challenge aims to teach some core concepts of arduino and electronics.

The brief summary about the challenges are as follows -

## Challenge 1 - Blinking LED

The LED is made to blink continuously. The on-off time of the LED can be changed by changing the delay value in the code.

## Challenge 2 - Fading LED

The LED is made to fade-in and fade-out from between off state and complete brightness. The time took by LED to fade-in and fade-out can be changed changing the delay value in the code.

## Challenge 3 - Coloured LED

## Challenge 4 - Color Wheel

## Challenge 5 - Color Control Button

## Challenge 6 - Color Mixer

## Challenge 7 - Toss a Coin

## Challenge 8 - Roll a Dice

## Challenge 9 - Rock Paper Scissor

## Challenge 10 - Automatic Light Control

## Challenge 11 - Burgler Alarm

## Challenge 12 - Laser Shooter

## Challenge 13 - Piano

## Challenge 14 - Theremin

## Challenge 15 - Ghost Detector

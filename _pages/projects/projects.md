## [Personal Website <i class="fas fa-link" style="color:#28B463"></i>](/projects/personal-website)
I am actively developing and maintaning my personal website. Mostly I have used free tools like Jekyll, Algolia, VSCode, Travis-CI etc. I will try to regularly publish articles on my arduino, MATLAB, electronics and some of my ever-evolving interests.
